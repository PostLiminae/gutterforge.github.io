  "body": [
    "Ended up getting devlogs page and expansion bays page to a minimum level of completeness—no working information yet, but it’s not going to for some time yet.",
    "Everything besides character creation is handled in terms of the TTRPG itself, so handling as much of the website as possible is required in the next few weeks.",
    "With the addition of the devlogs page I’ll end up making a few of these as things progress.",
    "As it stands, there is a basic vision coming into formation for The Gutter in terms of the project’s various pages on the website, and the mechanics and rule systems are already handled.",
    "It all needs a lot of polishing up before release, but an MVP should be ready before too long.",
    "Next up is going to end up being character creation in terms of the RPG work, and probably making up the ontological nursery page in terms of the website.",
    "Not sure which will take more time—I’ve already got a good idea of what character creation is going to end up looking like, and I want something on the ontological nursery page that really pops and stands out—not sure what yet."
